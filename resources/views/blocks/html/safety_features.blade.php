            <h2>Understanding Infrared Sauna Safety</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Infrared saunas heat the body using infrared panels instead of traditional heat sources like steam or hot air. This method presents unique safety challenges and benefits, making it essential to understand the technology and its implications.</p>

            <h2>Key Safety Features to Consider:</h2>
            <ul class="safety-features-list">
                <li>
                    <h4>Certified Infrared Panels</h4>
                    <p>Safety begins with the core element of any infrared sauna: the panels. It's crucial to use only high-quality panels specifically designed for sauna use. These should comply with safety standards and certifications like those issued by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or similar. Certified panels ensure that the electrical and heating components are safe and reliable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Proper Wiring and Electrical Components</h4>
                    <p>Electrical safety cannot be overstressed. Always use proper gauges and types of wiring, ensure all connections are secure, and adhere to local electrical codes. Using GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets for your sauna can prevent electrical shocks, automatically shutting down the power if a fault is detected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Heat Sensors and Timers</h4>
                    <p>Incorporating heat sensors in your sauna can help monitor the temperature and prevent overheating. Timers ensure that the sauna isn't left on for extended periods, reducing the risk of accidents and excessive energy consumption.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>High-Quality Materials</h4>
                    <p>The materials used in the construction of the sauna should be resistant to heat and moisture. Using non-toxic, non-combustible materials like cedar or hemlock wood not only ensures durability and resistance to mold but also maintains air quality inside the sauna.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Ventilation</h4>
                    <p>Proper ventilation is a must. This helps regulate temperature and humidity levels inside the sauna and prevents the buildup of stale air and potential contaminants. It also ensures that any off-gassing from heaters or construction materials is effectively expelled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Stable Construction</h4>
                    <p>The physical structure of your sauna should be robust and able to withstand regular use without risk of collapsing or deteriorating. Secure all joints and seams properly and use materials that sustain the repeated heating and cooling cycles.</p>
