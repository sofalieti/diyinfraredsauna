                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Far infrared sauna therapy</strong> is now being used as one of the main adjunctive therapies at many healing retreats and detoxification centers around the world. Patients and clients report that using the far infrared sauna is <strong>easy, non-invasive</strong> and that the experience of using an infrared sauna just feels good, like going to a high-end spa. By heating the body directly with far infrared heat, <strong>toxins are mobilized from the fat cells</strong>, where they are stored. The infrared sauna increases circulation which, in turn, aids in the final elimination of these chemicals through perspiration and the three other organs of elimination.</p>

                    <p>Today, unfortunately, we do not perspire the way that our ancestors did. Their lifestyles could be very rugged and required strenuous daily tasks just to stay alive. Our bodies were designed to <strong>sweat a good amount each and every day</strong> in order to maintain good health. Adding to that fact, we are now exposed to <strong>80,000 chemicals</strong> that our great-grandparents never were. The toxins that we are exposed to each day come from the air, water, food, cosmetic products we may use and even our clothing and bedding. When these chemicals are held in our body they build up to what is called a <strong>"toxic burden"</strong> which can actually cause a disease and a shorter lifespan.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Over time, and as we age, our bodies have a tendency to contract which can make even simple tasks seem difficult. A tight body may have to bend in strange contorted ways just to pick up an object. <strong>Poor posture caused from inflexibility can increase the chances for an injury</strong> to arise or even cause a fall from poor gait. Stiff muscles tend to weaken and such negatively effects our bones and joints, hence they fully rely on the support of our muscle tissue.</p>

                    <p>The infrared sauna can be an <strong>easy and effective way to improve flexibility</strong> and promote a healthy lifestyle. Experience this for yourself.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">When our adrenal and immune systems are worn down we become more susceptible to cold, flu, infections and other dis-eases. The soothing heat that surrounds you in the far infrared sauna allows a <strong>deep relaxed state while stress levels decrease</strong>. You can literally reset the ratio of stress/relaxation in your life.</p>

                    <p>The blood vessels open; (vasodilation), the heart rate increases; (passive cardio), muscles relax, pain is reduced as <strong>endorphins are released</strong>. Regular far infrared sauna therapy promotes a <strong>normalizing of the body's hormones</strong> through this effect on the autonomic nervous system.</p>

By contrast, the <strong>Infrared Sauna heats the body directly</strong>, while the air remains comfortable to breathe. This is because infrared heats the body directly, while passing through the air.</p>

                    <p>Infrared offers <strong>tremendous energy and time savings</strong> and as a bonus, the infrared sauna is ready to use in about <strong>fifteen minutes</strong> versus the normal one hour wait time for the Traditional sauna.</p>

                    <p>The deep heat of far infrared sauna therapy helps <strong>blood vessels dilate</strong>, bringing relief and healing to muscle and soft tissue injuries.

                    <p>Your body can safely burn up to <strong>300 to 500 calories in just one 30 minute session</strong>, equivalent to running 10-15km. As an added benefit, your basal metabolic rate rises, meaning you will <strong>burn calories at an elevated rate for hours</strong> after your session has finished. This can translate to a benefit of up to <strong>800 calories from a single session</strong>.</p>

                    <p>F.I.R.S.T. causes the release of <strong>endorphins</strong> from the brain, which are the body's natural opiates or pain killers. This reduces pain, relaxes muscles, and helps eliminate inflammation and swelling. The improved circulation helps <strong>remove toxins from your system</strong>, leading to better immune function and more restful sleep.</p>
